# v_calc
Simple command-line calculator. Supports some rather basic parsing and functions.
I've found myself often using a web browser as a calculator - I find it's a lot 
easier to enter and solve "complex" equations more quickly. I figured a command-line
calculator would use less battery, and I've been interested in both parsers and the
V language for a while. The code's pretty messy and I do apologize, but... oh well.
